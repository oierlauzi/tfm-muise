The thesis is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter, \nameref{chap:introduction}, lays the groundwork by providing an overview of the 3D classification problem, pointing out its complexities and challenges. Following this, the second chapter, \nameref{chap:spa}, presents a high-level look at the image processing pipeline employed in SPA, setting the stage for subsequent discussions. In the third chapter, \nameref{chap:state_of_the_art}, various methods for tackling the 3D classification problem are examined, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The fourth chapter, \nameref{chap:implementation}, delves into the specific approach adopted to address the problem, offering a detailed description of the methodology employed. Chapter five, \nameref{chap:results}, follows providing a meticulous account of the experiments conducted and their corresponding outcomes. The document then progresses to the sixth chapter, \nameref{chap:conclusions}, where findings are synthesized, and implications are discussed. Finally, in the seventh chapter, \nameref{chap:future}, potential avenues for further research and development are explored.
