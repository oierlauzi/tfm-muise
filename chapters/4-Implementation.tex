In this project we aim to develop a novel method for determining a reliable initial 3D classification. Doing so, many of the inconveniences related to the current \gls{em} and 3D variations analysis approaches are avoided. The algorithm detailed on this chapter provides a high quality initial solution to the subsequent \gls{em} iterations. Doing so, the \gls{em} algorithm's convergence will be biased towards the correct solution, avoiding local minima and attraction problem. This increased quality of the initial solution also implies that fewer \gls{em} iterations are demanded, which in conjunction with the computational efficiency of the algorithm, allows for a significant speed up on the 3D classification process. Lastly, very few hyper-parameters are required to be tuned to achieve correct results.
